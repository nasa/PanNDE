# Welcome to PanNDE!

PanNDE is an attempt at building a modular, developable infrastructure for doing field simulations (initially elastodynamic) for Non-Destructive Evaluation applications. Performance as well as low-level access is a key concern to enable rapid, adaptive modelling for model inversion or for MAPOD like applications. As with all research, work begets work, and development will hopefully continue. For now, if you find use for this, great, and if not, hopefully future development will bring features that are useful, or that the code base provides a jumping-off point for other development by other researchers. For now, good luck, and have fun! Science is a grand adventure!

# Building PanNDE

1. Download latest release
2. Ensure correct dependencies are installed, and are in the search path
  - MPI
  - VTK >= 9.0 (linked with the same MPI being used for PanNDE)
  - Metis
  - gcc >= 7.3
  - cmake >= 3.13.5
3. Ensure Python3 is installed for some included post processing utilities
  - this is optional, if the utilities are not desired
  - recommended to use a python virtual environement 
  - required packages are in py_utils/requirements.txt
4. cd to `PanNDE/root/directory`
5. Ensure that MPI, VTK, and Metis are in your search path
  - example `export PATH=/path/to/package/bin:$PATH`
6. generate compilation instructions using `cmake -B build -S .`
  - Available flags (default is ON) are:
    - `DGO_TEST:bool=False` turns off building tests
    - `DGO_PROF:bool=False` turns off compiling with profiler hooks
7. compile with `make -C build`

# Running the Test Suites

1. Ensure PanNDE is built on the system
2. Run serial tests:
  - `./bin/HostDataTests > HostDataTestResults.log`
3. Run parallel tests:
  - `mpirun -n 4 -outfile-pattern=NetMPITestResult_%r.log ./bin/NetMPITests`
  - `mpirun -n 4 -outfile-pattern=VTKIOTestResult_%r.log ./bin/VTKIOTests`
  - `mpirun -n 4 -outfile-pattern=HostSolverTestResult_%r.log ./bin/HostSolverTests`


# Python Utilities 

All python utilities can be found in ./py_utils.  Python >= 3.11.11 is required along with the following packages:
- matplotlib>=3.10.0
- numpy>=2.2.1
- scipy>=1.14.1
- vtk>=9.4.1 


# Creating a Demonstration Case

1. Ensure PanNDE is built on the system
2. All examples can bebuilt using the files in ./py_utils/Case_Makers
  -  Composite_Laminate_Transducer_Case_Maker.py
    - run with `TransducerModel`
  -  Small_Composite_Laminate_Transducer_Case_Maker.py
    - run with `TransducerModel`
  -  Large_Plate_wHoles_Transducer_Case_Maker.py
    - run with `TransducerModel`
  -  Small_Plate_wHoles_Transducer_Case_Maker.py
    - run with `TransducerModel`
  -  Ti64_Angle_Bracket_Water_Column_Case_Maker.py
    - run with `WaterColumnModel`
  -  AL_Angle_Bracket_Crack_Transducer_Case_Maker_Parametric.py
    - run with `TransducerModel`
  -  AL_Angle_Bracket_Water_Column_Case_Maker.py
    - run with `WaterColumnModel`

# Running a Case

1. Ensure PanNDE is built on the system
2. Produce a `*.vtu` file that provides all required input data
  - For required data, see Job File Requirements, below
3. Run `mpirun -n $NPROCS ./bin/$MODEL -f $JOB_FILE -o $RESULT_FILE_NAME_ROOT`
  - results will be written to a `*.pvtu`/`*.vtu` set with appropriate file numbering schema for reconstruction in scientific visualization software
